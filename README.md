# This app was built as part of a module I was doing at University and was the first React-Native project I have ever woked on. 
# There are some improvements I would like to make over time and adding a fully functioning Node.js backend is the next item on my list.
# I have implemented a lot of JavaScript skills across the components and I am keen to add more to my skill base.
